All practice and course work related to the McMaster University course MECHTRON 2MP3: Programming for Mechatronics. 

# ðŸ•® Course Description 
This course focuses on learning programming using the high-level systems programming language C, and on understanding how its features are implemented using the CPU and the memory hierarchy. Mathematical abstractions are implemented using fundamental data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, etc., with static and dynamic memory allocation.
